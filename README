Finally had some time to look for the correct make flags for a
64 bit JVM (1.6.0_24) running on OSX 10.6.7

Apple is "supported" platform again !!!!

=====
I have added an additional "position" argument to the getxattr and setxattr
methods, the version before this change was tagged (b4_xattr)
However extended attributes should work in either version.


=====
Note: I am building on:
Mac OS X 10.6.8
Fuse4X-0.8.13.dmg


The maven project(s) can be built by:

cd maven
mvn install


The native executable can be built by:

cd native
make


To mount the "Fake" filesystem.

cd extra
mkdir fake
./mount_fake.sh


This will mount to the "fake" directory you just created.



To run in the background (test it first in the foreground)
Edit mount_fake.sh and remove the -f flag

umount fake
./mount_fake.sh
